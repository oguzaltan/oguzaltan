# üëã Hi there, I'm **Oguz Altan**
I am a researcher at the University of Applied Sciences (FHDW) Paderborn, working on the SilvaBot project ‚Äî a fully autonomous system for scalable, climate-adapted forest conversion. My research focuses on the development of robotics software architectures for ground and aerial robots, including multi-sensor fusion, task and motion planning, navigation, mapping, perception, swarm intelligence, and obstacle avoidance in dynamic environments.

I hold an M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering, Information Technology, and Computer Engineering from RWTH Aachen University (specialization: Systems and Automation) and a B.Sc. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Bilkent University. My interests lie at the intersection of AI and robotics, including machine learning, deep reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, and control theory.

Previously, I optimized UAV trajectories using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning at Fraunhofer FKIE, developed an autonomous ground robot for my Bachelor‚Äôs project, and contributed to AI-driven process monitoring in Siemens‚Äô Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAMAI) project. I also gained experience in embedded systems and signal processing during my internship at Fraunhofer IIS.
