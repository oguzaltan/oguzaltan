# 👋 Hi there, I'm **Oguz Altan**
I am a researcher at the University of Applied Sciences (FHDW) Paderborn, where I work on robotics software and AI projects. Current project that I work on is SilvaBot - Fully Autonomous Robot for Scalable, Climate-Change-Adapted Forest Conversion. As a robotics software engineer, I contribute to the development of autonomous systems for ground and aerial robots aimed at reforesting areas affected by climate change and wildfires. Our approach uses swarm intelligence to enable scalable, efficient, and adaptive forest restoration.

I completed my M.Sc. at RWTH Aachen University in the Electrical Engineering and Information Technology Department, with a major in Systems and Automation. Prior to my Master’s degree, I obtained my B.Sc. degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Bilkent University. My research interests center around AI and robotics, particularly in machine learning, reinforcement learning, deep learning, multi-agent systems, and control theory. Throughout my academic and professional life, I have gained experience in research and development in these fields.

My academic and professional journey includes optimizing UAV trajectories using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning for my Master’s Thesis at Fraunhofer FKIE and developing an autonomous land robot for my Bachelor’s final year project. Additionally, I gained valuable experience in machine and deep learning, automation, and process monitoring through Siemens’ AI-integrated Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing project, as well as embedded systems during my internship at Fraunhofer IIS.

“Actions such as his could come only from a robot, or from a very honorable and decent human being. But you see, you can’t differentiate between a robot and the very best of humans.”
