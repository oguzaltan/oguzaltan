# üëã Hi there, I'm **Oguz Altan**
I am a researcher at the **University of Applied Sciences (FHDW) Paderborn**, working on the **SilvaBot** project, which is a fully autonomous system for scalable, climate-adapted forest conversion. My research focuses on the development of **robotics software and hardware architectures** for ground and aerial robots.

My interests lie at the intersection of **AI and robotics**, including machine learning, deep reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, and control theory.

I hold an M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering, Information Technology, and Computer Engineering from **RWTH Aachen University** and a B.Sc. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from **Bilkent University**.

Previously, I optimized UAV trajectories using **multi-agent deep reinforcement learning** at **Fraunhofer FKIE**, developed an **autonomous ground robot** for my Bachelor‚Äôs project, and contributed to **AI-driven process monitoring** in **Siemens**‚Äô Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAMAI) project. I also worked on **embedded systems** during my internship at **Fraunhofer IIS**.
